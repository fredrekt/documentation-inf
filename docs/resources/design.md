# Design 

Frontend/User end is built with GatsbyJS **a React-based framework**.

Dashboard/Backoffice is built with just **ReactJS**.

### Kits & Frameworks

- [BaseWeb](https://baseweb.design/) also has CSS in JS ([styletron](https://www.styletron.org/)).
- [Material Design Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/react/) same as bootstrap but better looking.
- [Trend Micro Sidenav](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trendmicro/react-sidenav) used in dashboard's sidenav.
